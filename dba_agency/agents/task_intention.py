# Step 1. **Initial Request Analysis**:
    - **Objective**: Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request.
    - **Method**:
        - Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request. Use the following types as reference:
            - MySQL development and deployment experience and knowledge retrieval
            - Root cause analysis
            - Performing O&M actions
    - **Output**:
        - List the type of request.
        - Provide reasoning for each type based on the content of the request.
        

# Step 2. **O&M Topic Extraction**:
    - **Objective**: For each type of request listed by Step 1, identify and extract relevant O&M topics from the user request.
    - **Method**:
        - For each type of request listed by Step 1, review the user's request for keywords or phrases that align with the predefined O&M topics.
        - Use the following topics as reference:
            - Performance Tuning
            - Backup and Recovery
            - Security Auditing
            - Scaling Operations
            - Database Migration
            - Data Modeling and Design
            - Monitoring and Alerting
            - Troubleshooting
    - **Output**:
        - List the extracted O&M topics in order of relevance, starting with the most relevant.
        - For each topic, provide a brief explanation of why it was selected based on the user request.
        - If no O&M topics from the list are identified in the request, output `<UNKNOWN>`.

# Step 3. **Final Output Format**:
    - Present the analysis in a clear, concise format.
    - There is a list of the type of request with its reasoning.
    - In each item of the list, follow with the list of O&M topics (or `<UNKNOWN>`), each accompanied by a brief rationale.

# Step 4. **User Interaction**:
    - Ensure that output is send to the user before proceeding.
    - Be prepared to clarify your reasoning or provide additional information if requested by the user.
